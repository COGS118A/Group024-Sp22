    "# Abstract \n",
    "Our project is centered around accurately predicting the price of flights to find the best booking times and routes. Our goal is to enable customers to plan their trips as efficiently and cost effective as possible. We will examine data collected from ‘Easemytrip,’ an online booking platform, between February 11th and March 31st of 2022 that includes flight information from India about airline companies, flight codes, source/destination cities, flight times, and more. There are 12 total features that mostly take the form of discrete categorical variables (‘Delhi,’ ‘morning,’ ‘economy,’ etc.), and includes 300,000 unique observations. We plan on implementing both a decision tree and linear regression model to make our predictions. Each method will be compared to evaluate which provides a higher success rate. We will measure the performance of our linear regression model by utilizing both a R-squared and adjusted R-squared metric to evaluate. We will then evaluate our decision tree success rate by using K-means cross validation (using ~⅕ of the data as a test set) to determine how generalizable our decision criteria are to any given portion of the data."

So use the method that works for you, but do use inline citations.\n",

It is a score between 0 and 1 where 1 indicates a perfect fit between predicted and actual values. \n",
